- Company email uses per-org IMAP/SMTP credentials encrypted with EMAIL_CREDENTIALS_KEY inside edge functions (_shared/mail.ts); the browser never reads passwords. Why: each company connects its own mailbox.
- Legacy booking status changes use the explicit service type and an acknowledged, organization-authorized invoker RPC; why: prevent wrong-table no-ops and bypassing tenant permissions.
- Email read-state changes use an acknowledged, organization-scoped RPC restricted to visible threads and read fields; why: queue readers can persist state without gaining assignment or workflow write access.
